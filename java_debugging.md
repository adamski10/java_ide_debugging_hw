Answer the following questions:
1. What is the purpose of a breakpoint?

The breakpoint tells the application where to stop executing the code, so from that point the debugger can be used.

2. Does the line of code on a breakpoint run when you start debugging?

NO, it breaks before it runs the line at which the breakpoint is placed.

3. How do we debug the next line of code?
The step over takes us to the next line of code.

4. What does the step into command do?

It allows to see what is happening inside the given method, once it steps into the method it stops at the very top of it.

5. What is the difference between evaluate expression and evaluate code fragment?

Evaluation of expression refers to just one expresion whereas evaluation of code fragment refers to several lines of code, like assigning to variables and calling more than one method.
